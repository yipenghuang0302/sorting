 Setting the initial values for the off-diagonals to $0$ will prevent the algorithm from starting in the first place. Initial $y$ values that are too small may stop the algorithm mid-way and result in an approximate sorting with two elements being out of place. After the diagonal entries converge to their final state, the $y$ values are nonzero, but in the magnitude of less than $10^{30}$. How big the initial off-diagonal entries have to be might depend on the ratio of the numbers to sort.

 The finite Toda lattice system of ODEs that our analog sorter relies on belongs to special class of ODEs called Hamiltonian systems.
-Hamiltonian systems are an important and efficient way to describe classical mechanics.
+Hamiltonian systems are an important and efficient way to describe mechanics.
 Because of their importance, special ODE solvers called symplectic solvers have been developed specifically to solve Hamiltonian systems.
 
 A Hamiltonian system is characterized by a total energy scalar $\hham$.
 The components of the system are described by vectors $p$ for momenta and $q$ for positions.
 The system obeys the laws of motion:
 \begin{align}
-\frac{dp}{dt} = -\frac{dH}{dq} = f(q) \qquad \qquad
-\frac{dq}{dt} = \frac{dH}{dp} = g(p)
+\frac{dp}{dt} = -\frac{d\hham}{dq} = f(q) \qquad \qquad
+\frac{dq}{dt} = \frac{d\hham}{dp} = g(p)

+In order to explore how analog sorting works in larger systems, we use an ODE solver built on the odeint solver in the Python SciPy library~\cite{scipy}.
 We first construct an array of variables, an array of the ODEs from (5), and an array of initial values, which we supply to SciPy's odeint. The initial values for $x$ are randomly chosen from a dynamic range using randint from Python's random module. The initial $y$ values are set at 0.9. SciPy's odeint returns the values of $x$ and $y$ at each specified time interval of 0.04 seconds. 
 
 The data is used to plot graphs, but also to determine when the $x$ values have settled in at their final value.

 In addition, the $y_k$ values should be small (but still positive). Recall that the eigenvalues will be the values along the diagonal of $H$ as $t\rightarrow \infty$. Consider the determinant $f_n = \det (H-\lambda I)$, where $n$ is the size of the matrix. Since $H$ is a tridiagonal matrix, this determinant can be formulated using a recurrence relation on the size of the matrix $n$.
