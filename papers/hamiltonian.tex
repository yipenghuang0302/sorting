\newcommand*{\hham}{\hat{\mathcal{H}}}
The finite Toda lattice system of ODEs belongs to special class of ODEs called Hamiltonian systems.
Hamiltonian systems are an important and efficient way to describe classical mechanics.
Because of their importance, special ODE solvers called symplectic solvers have been developed specifically to solve Hamiltonian systems.

A Hamiltonian system is characterized by a total energy scalar $\hham$.
The components of the system are described by vectors $p$ for momenta and $q$ for positions.
The system obeys the laws of motion:
\begin{align}
dp/dt &= -dH/dq = f(q)
dq/dt &= dH/dp = g(p)
\end{align}

% x and p encode what you want to sort
Conceptually, we encode the keys we like to sort as the momenta of particles.
The momenta of the particles carries them to a final state that represents the sorted system.
