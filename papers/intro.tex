The focus of this paper is on an analog sorting algorithm that is deeply connected to the Toda Lattice system.

In contrast to well-known sorting algorithms such as merge or quick sort, 
the analog algorithm discussed here sorts values in a continuous way. In fact, it is the continuous time equivalent of the QR algorithm. 

The theory behind analog sorting relies on the Toda lattice, which has been thoroughly discussed by the mathematical community. Adding to the theory, this paper aims to show results of testing analog sorting on a chip and simulating the system using an ODE solver. Ultimately, we evaluate the complexity of analog sorting in comparison to other sorting algorithms.
